Advent Of Code is an annual programming competition with Christmas themed challenges that can be solved in most program languages.

Some of the problems have been completed in python, others in Java. I may even attempt Kotlin at some point.

The solutions were implemented for fun and to brush up on py3 features or refresh my Java knowledge. 

Its not production quality code. Though most of them have unittests and are reasonably well documented.

Unfortunately, christmas nights out, shopping and real-life meant I never had a chance to complete them in December. 

If can finish them before December \__2024\__ I'll be happy :-D
